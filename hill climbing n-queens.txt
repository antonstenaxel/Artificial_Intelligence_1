1. 1 -> solved
	2 -> cannot be solved (is also unsolvable)
	3 -> cannot be solved (is also unsolvable)
	4 -> solved in 3 times
	5 -> solved
	6 -> solved
	7 -> solved
	8 -> not solved after 5 times
	9 -> solved after 2 times
	10 -> solved after 3 times
	11 -> not solved after 5 times
	12 -> not solved after 5 times
	13 -> not solved after 5 times
	14 -> not solved after 5 times
	15 -> not solved after 5 times
	16 -> not solved after 5 times

2. ?

3. Improvements after making the algorithms
