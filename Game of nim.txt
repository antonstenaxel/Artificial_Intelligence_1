1.
For n=3: Max will take 2 matches, so there will be only 1 left for Min. So Max will win.
For n=4: Max will take 3 matches, so there will be only 1 left for Min. So Max will win.
For n=5: If Max takes 1 match, Min will do the strategy for n=4 and wins.
			If Max takes 2 matches,  Min will do the strategy for n=3 and wins.
			If Max takes 3 matches, Min will take 1 match and Max has to take the last one, so Min wins again.
			This means that Min wins.
For n=6: Max will take 1 match, so Min has 5 matches left and automatically loses the same way as Max as he begins with 5 matches. Max wins.
